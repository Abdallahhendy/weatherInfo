# Weather Info
I've practice what I learned in how to fetch data by using an API. I target the weather info as it is frequently asked by most humans while going to the work, school, doing something at home, and others.
There're several sites to be used to apply the idea, search the best for you if this doesn't make sense with you.

A Little Tip:
> **Practice** is the bridge between learning and mastery. Keep improving!.
